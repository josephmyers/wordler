## Wordler

Welcome to the Wordler GitHub page! See [here](https://wordler.dev) for the production site.

# Overview

Wordler is a basic aid for arriving at solutions to the Wordle game. It's easy enough to make a solver for Wordle, but what about those who want only a little help without having the answer given to them outright? Wordler provides a way to see all possible answers as you play the game yourself. Simply tell Wordler what words you're using and how Wordle is responding to those words.

# Bugs

Feel free to report any issues you find! This is my first experiment with React, so I also welcome code comments and suggestions.
